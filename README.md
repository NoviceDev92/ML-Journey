# My Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository documents my projects and progress in machine learning. It contains hands-on implementations of various algorithms to deepen my understanding of the concepts.

## Projects

### 1. Linear Regression

* **Description:** An implementation of linear regression to predict a continuous target variable.
* **Methods Used:**
    * **Gradient Descent:** An iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a cost function.
    * **Normal Equations:** A closed-form solution to find the parameters that minimize the cost function.

### 2. Logistic Regression

* **Description:** An implementation of logistic regression for a classification task.
* **Methods Used:**
    * **Gradient Ascent:** An iterative optimization algorithm used to find the maximum of a likelihood function.
    * **Newton-Raphson Method:** An iterative method for finding the roots of a function, adapted here for optimization.
